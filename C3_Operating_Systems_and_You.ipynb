    "\n",
    "[Article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/technet-magazine/hh148159(v=msdn.10)) 08/31/2016 Raymond Chen\n",
    "\n",
    "_When you get the stats for the size of a folder, where, exactly, do those measurements come from?_\n",
    "\n",
    "When you right-click to view the properties of a folder, the property sheet includes two values: Size and Size on disk. What exactly do these values mean? What are they measuring?\n",
    "\n",
    "The property sheet performs a naïve recursive directory search for all files. It doesn’t try to filter out file names referring to the same underlying file by means of a hard link. If you don’t have access to a subdirectory, the recursive directory search will skip that subdirectory, and those files won’t be counted in the total folder size.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, the recursive directory search has some smarts. Part of it is being smart on purpose: It detects reparse points and doesn’t recurse into them. Another part is being smart by accident: Symbolic links to files count as zero size. This isn’t because the directory search code is clever about the files. It’s because the directory entry for symbolic links reports them as having zero size. Now you know what files are counted, but where do those numbers come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Size measurement is easy: It’s a running tally of the file sizes as reported by the FindFirstFile function in the WIN32_FIND_DATA.nFileSizeLow and nFileSizeHigh. Mind you, those values aren’t necessarily accurate either because of the way the NTFS file system updates directory entries. That’s a topic for another day, but the short version is that files still being written to may not report an accurate file size until the file handle is closed. Even then, it will only update the directory entry used to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Size on disk measurement is more complicated. If the drive supports compression (as reported by the FILE_FILE_COMPRESSION flag returned by the GetVolumeInformation function) and the file is compressed or sparse (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_COMPRESSED, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SPARSE_FILE), then the Size on disk for a file is the value reported by the GetCompressedFileSize function. This reports the compressed size of the file (if compressed) or the size of the file minus the parts that were de-committed and logically treated as zero (if sparse). If the file is neither compressed nor sparse, then the Size on disk is the file size reported by the FindFirstFile function rounded up to the nearest cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Windows 95 team originally developed the Size on disk algorithm. Their view of the file system world was biased by their MS-DOS background. There the only disk file system was FAT. There was no such thing as a hard link or alternate data stream. File contents were stored in units of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those assumptions don't hold true for NTFS—not even the “file contents are stored in units of clusters” part. In NTFS, a file can actually consume zero clusters for its data by stashing itself into slack space in the master file table (MFT). (For more details on this, see “[The Four Stages of NTFS File Growth](https://blogs.technet.com/b/askcore/archive/2009/10/16/the-four-stages-of-ntfs-file-growth.aspx)”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, the Size on disk algorithm doesn’t take into account other file system overhead, like the disk space occupied by the file name itself, directory entry information, file metadata and alternate data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values reported by Size and Size on disk aren’t meant to be a byte-for-byte accounting of the total impact of a directory on your disk free space. They’re just a rough estimate based on the assumption that most files are of the boring variety. By that, I mean no hard links and negligible use of alternate data streams. If you have a directory with numerous hard links—such as the Windows directory itself, for example—the values will be way off.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Size on disk as a sniff-test to get a rough idea of the size of a directory, but remember that it’s a naïve calculation. If you need to keep careful tabs on disk consumption, you’d be better off using a feature like Disk Quotas, whose purpose is to more intelligently track disk consumption."

    "Although many alternatives for user authentication are available today, most users log on to their computer and remote computers using a combination of their user name and a password typed at their keyboard. There are products that use more secure technologies such as biometrics, smart cards, and one-time passwords available for all popular operating systems; but the reality is that many organizations still rely on passwords and they will continue to do so for years to come. Users often have many different computer accounts at work, for their cell phone, at their bank, with insurance companies, and so on. To make it easier to remember their passwords, users often use the same or similar passwords on each system; and given a choice, most users will select a very simple and easy-to-remember password such as their birthday, their mother's maiden name, or the name of a relative. Short and simple passwords are relatively easy for attackers to determine. Some common methods that attackers use for discovering a victim's password include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Guessing-The attacker attempts to log on using the user's account by repeatedly guessing likely words and phrases such as their children's names, their city of birth, and local sports teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Online Dictionary Attack-The attacker uses an automated program that includes a text file of words. The program repeatedly attempts to log on to the target system using a different word from the text file on each try.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offline Dictionary Attack-Similar to the online dictionary attack, the attacker gets a copy of the file where the hashed or encrypted copy of user accounts and passwords are stored and uses an automated program to determine what the password is for each account. This type of attack can be completed very quickly once the attacker has managed to get a copy of the password file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offline Brute Force Attack-This is a variation of the dictionary attacks, but it is designed to determine passwords that may not be included in the text file used in those attacks. Although a brute force attack can be attempted online, due to network bandwidth and latency they are usually undertaken offline using a copy of the target system's password file. In a brute force attack the attacker uses an automated program that generates hashes or encrypted values for all possible passwords and compares them to the values in the password file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these attack methods can be slowed down significantly or even defeated through the use of strong passwords. Therefore, whenever possible, computer users should use strong passwords for all of their computer accounts. Computers running versions of Windows based on Microsoft Windows NT, including Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, support strong passwords. In Windows, a strong password is a password that includes characters from at least three of the five groups in the following Character Classes table.\n",

This document describes how passwords are stored in the Windows family of operating systems and gives guidance to Administrators on how to maximize the security of their passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "These contradictory requirements can be overcome by thinking about pass phrases rather than passwords. Every version of Windows that supports strong passwords supports the use of spaces and punctuation symbols in account passwords. For example, \"I re@lly want to buy 11 Dogs!\" is a valid pass phrase. With more than twenty characters it is a very long pass phrase, and it includes characters from 4 of the 5 possible groups. It is also easy to remember! Most password cracking tools assume the password will never exceed 14 characters, which is the limit that DOS network boot disks, Microsoft Remote Installation Services (RIS) Pre eXecutable Environment (PXE) boot disks, and older LAN Manager clients (Win9x) must utilize. Even without complexity, a very long password (>14 characters, up to 128 characters) can be the best possible protection against having an especially sensitive password broken.\n",

    "Note: Do not use the example passwords within this document. Although the password discussed above, \"I re@lly want to buy 11 Dogs!\", is very long and complex, attackers may add it and other sample passwords in this document to their attack tools.\n",

    "If administrators have legacy systems, RIS, or similar requirements to adhere to, or if they simply dislike dealing with an especially lengthy password, using a shorter password with complex characters offers good protection.

Most brute force password cracking tools start out by search for alphanumeric characters and symbols present on most keyboards such as ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ - + = (sometimes called the \"upper row symbols\" because they appear on the top row of most U.S. keyboards).

    "To organization members:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak and blank passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into your computer and our organization's network. Passwords that are used for years at a time, or passwords that are reused frequently, are also much more likely to be discovered by an attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the protection of your account on the network, you are required to use strong passwords when accessing corporate computer systems. You will be required to change your password periodically, and you will be required to use passwords that do not match your previous passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong password is a password that is at least eight characters long and uses characters from three of the five following groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lowercase letters\n",
    "- Uppercase letters\n",
    "- Numbers (for instance, 1, 2, 3)\n",
    "- Symbols (for instance, @, =, -, and so on)\n",
    "- Unicode characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Your passwords will also not be able to contain three or more consecutive letters from your user account name. You will be required to change your password every 42 days, and you will not be able to reuse passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you change your password, your new password will automatically be checked for complexity and it will be compared to your previous passwords. This may sound like a frustrating situation and you may be tempted to write down your password and paste it to your desk, computer monitor, or some other easily accessed location. However, the moment you do that you are exposing your computer and our entire organization to tremendous risk as anyone could walk up to your computer and log on to the network using your credentials. Therefore, never write down your passwords. Instead, create passwords that are easy to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you'll find some more background information about password security as well as specific advice on how to create strong passwords that are easy to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Pass Phrases**\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps it might be easier to think in terms \"pass phrases\" rather than \"passwords.\" If your computer is running Windows NT 4.0 or earlier, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, passwords up to fifteen or more characters are supported, including spaces. Therefore, \"You can try to break this until the cows come home!\" is a perfectly valid pass phrase that will be extremely difficult for an attacker to break even using the best password cracking tool around. If your computer is running one of the operating systems mentioned above, try to use a very long pass phrase that includes a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you should not actually use the example passwords within this document, although the password discussed above, \"You can try to break this until the cows come home \" is very long attackers may add it and other sample passwords in this document to their attack tools. These are examples, you should always create your own unique passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "**More Password Tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following information provides tips and do's and don'ts for creating and remembering passwords and password phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use more than one word**\n",
    "Instead of only using the name of someone you know, such as \"Allison\", choose something about that person no one else knows about, for instance, \"AllisonsBear\" or \"AlliesBear\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use symbols instead of characters**\n",
    "Many people tend to put the required symbols and numbers at the end of a word they know, for instance, \"Allison1234\". Unfortunately, this is relatively easy to break. The word \"Allison\" is in a lot of dictionaries that include common names; once the name is discovered, the attacker has only four more relatively easy characters to guess. Instead, replace one or more of the letters within the word with symbols that you'll easily recall. Many people have their own creative interpretations of what letter some symbols and numbers resemble. For example, try substituting \"@\" for \"A\", \"!\" for \"l\", a zero (0) for an \"O\", a `$` for an \"S\", and a \"3\" for an \"E\". With substitutions such as these, \"@llis0nbe@r\", \"A!!isonB3ar\", and \"A//i$onBear\" are all recognizable to you, but they would be extremely difficult to guess or break. Look at the symbols on your keyboard and think of the first character that comes to mind-it might not be what someone else would think of, but you will remember it. Use some of those symbols as substitutions for your passwords from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choose events or people that are on your mind**\n",
    "To remember a strong password that will have to change in several months, try selecting an upcoming personal or public event. Use this as an opportunity to remind yourself about something pleasant that is going on in your life, or a person whom you admire or love. You won't be likely to forget the password if it is funny or endearing. Make it unique to you. Be sure to make it a phrase of two or more words, and continue to slip in your symbols. For example: \"J0hn$Gr@du@tion\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use phonetics in the words**\n",
    "In general, password dictionaries used by attackers search for words embedded inside your password. As mentioned before, don't hesitate to use the words, but make sure you liberally sprinkle those words with embedded symbols. Another way to trump the attacker is to avoid spelling the words properly, or use funny phonetics that you can remember. For instance, \"Run for the hills\" could become \"R0n4dHiLLs!\" or \"R0n 4 d Hills!\" If your manager's name happens to be Ron, you might even get a chuckle each morning typing this in. If you are a lousy speller, you are ahead of the game already.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Don't be afraid to make the password long**\n",
    "If you remember it better as a full phrase, go ahead and type it in. Longer passwords are much harder to break. And even though it is long, if it is easy for you to remember, you will probably have a lot less trouble getting into your system, even if you aren't the best typist in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use first letters of a phrase**\n",
    "To create an easy-to-remember and strong password, begin with a properly capitalized and punctuated sentence that is easy for you to remember. For example: \"My daughter Kay goes to the International School.\" Next, take the first letter of each word in your sentence, preserving the capitalization used in the sentence. In the example above \"MdKgttIS\" would be the result. Finally substitute some non-alphanumeric characters for some of the letters in the password. You might use an \"@\" to replace an \"a\" or use an \"!\" to replace an \"L\". After one such substitution the example password above would be \"MdKgtt!S\"-a very difficult password to break, yet a password that is easy for you to remember, as long as you can recall the sentence on which the password is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do's:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine letters, symbols, and numbers that are easy for you to remember and hard for someone else to guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create pronounceable passwords (even if they are not words) that are easier to remember, reducing the temptation to write down your password.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try out using the initial letters of a phrase you love, especially if a number or special character is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take two familiar things, and then wrap them around a number or special character. Alternatively, change the spelling to include a special character. In this manner, you get one unfamiliar thing (which makes a good password because it is easy for you and you alone to remember, but hard for anyone else to discover). Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Phone + 4 + you\" = \"Phone4you\" or \"Fone4y0u\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"cat + * + Mouse\" = \"cat*Mouse\" or \"cat*Mou$e\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"attack + 3 + book\" = \"attack3booK\" or \"@tack3booK\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don'ts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use personal information such as derivatives of your user ID, names of family members, maiden names, cars, license tags, telephone numbers, pets, birthdays, social security numbers, addresses, or hobbies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use any word in any language spelled forward or backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't tie passwords to the month, for example, don't use \"Mayday\" in May.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't create new passwords that are substantially similar to ones you've previously used."
